## :books: Introduction
 We present **DSCformer**, a lightweight and high-precision deep learning model for predicting soil nitrogen content. 
 
 Combining the feature extraction capabilities of the **Metaformer architecture** with the efficiency of **deep separable convolution(DSC)**, DSCformer achieves a breakthrough in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency for soil nutrient prediction.

**Key innovations** of DSCformer include:
- Integration of **deep separable convolution(DSC)** to reduce model complexity.
- A highly efficient architecture with only **20.86K parameters** and **1.08 MFLOPs**.
- Superior performance, achieving **RMSE: 0.98 g¬∑kg‚Åª¬π**, **R¬≤: 0.928**, and ultra-fast runtimes (**4.265ms on CPU**, **0.071ms on GPU**).
- Enhanced **interpretability** using the **SHAP method**, which highlights critical spectral bands (e.g., **2020-2080 nm**, **2410-2440 nm**).
